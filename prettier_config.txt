Hi,
To use Prettier correctly (if you don't know what Prettier is, it's a module that formats your code correctly,
like this, so everyone has the same formatting style as you), you need to follow these steps:

- Install the Prettier module (on VSCODE, you need to press "CTRL"/"CMD" + "SHIFT" + "X" and search for "Prettier - Code formatter")

- Install the ESLint module (on VSCODE, you need to press "CTRL"/"CMD" + "SHIFT" + "X" and search for "ESLint")

- Configure Prettier. To do this, press "CTRL"/"CMD" + "SHIFT" + "P" and type "Open User Settings JSON". Be careful, choose JSON!

After that, paste these commands into the JSON file:


{
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "prettier.requireConfig": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll.eslint": "always",
        "source.organizeImports": "always"
    }
}
